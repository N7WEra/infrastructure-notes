# Initial page

I have gathered these notes from lots of sources on the internet, such as OSCP guides, enumeration guides and books. If you see any content that you wrote and I haven't credited you, please let me know and I will add it.

It's worth remembering that this is **not a guide** to infrastructure testing, it's more like a **cheat sheet** to give you an idea of what to do and how to do it.



You can find all the notes in a git format here, available to download:
