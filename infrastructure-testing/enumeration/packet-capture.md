# Packet Capture

## Tcpdump

**Save a packet capture:** 

`tcpdump -i  -s0 -w pcapfile.pcap`

Ctrl-C to stop after about 5 minutes. 

Replay capture and look for interesting protocols:

`tcpdump -r pcapfile.pcap not  and not arp`

Tcpdump filter for DHCPv6:

`tcpdump -i eth0 -n -vv '(udp port 546 or 547) or icmp6`

Tcpdump filter based on a range:

`tcpdump -i eth0 -s0 -w nix01.pcap net 172.16.1.0/24`

## Wireshark

**Router solicitation filter**

When analyzing IPv6 traffic in Wireshark, you can simply use the filter `icmpv6.type==133` to show only "Router Solicitation" messages.



## BruteShark

BruteShark is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool \(NFAT\) that performs deep processing and inspection of network traffic \(mainly PCAP files\). It includes: password extracting, building a network map, reconstruct TCP sessions, extract hashes of encrypted passwords and even convert them to a Hashcat format in order to perform an offline Brute Force attack.
