### Crunch 

crunch enables us to create a custom password-cracking wordlist that we can use with such tools like Hashcat, Cain and Abel, John the Ripper, Aircrack-ng, and others. This custom wordlist might be able to save us hours or days in password cracking if we can craft it properly. 

Syntax: 

`kali > crunch <min> max<max> <characterset> -t <pattern> -o <output filename>` 

Example: 

`crunch 4 4 -f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst lalpha-numeric -o wordlist.txt` 

We could generate all the possibilities of ten-character passwords that end with 0728 and send the output to a file in the root user's directory named birthdaywordlist.lst, by typing: 

`crunch 10 10 -t @@@@@@0728 -o /root/birthdaywordlist.lst`
