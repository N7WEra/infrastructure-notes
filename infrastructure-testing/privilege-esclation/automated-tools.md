## PEASS

PEASS - Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE

Link: [https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/README.md)

These tools search for possible **local privilege escalation paths** that you could exploit and print them to you **with nice colors** so you can recognize the misconfigurations easily.

* Check the **Local Windows Privilege Escalation checklist** from [**book.hacktricks.xyz**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation)
* [**WinPEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS) **- Windows local Privilege Escalation Awesome Script \(C\#.exe and .bat\)**
* Check the **Local Linux Privilege Escalation checklist** from [**book.hacktricks.xyz**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist)
* [**LinPEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) **- Linux local Privilege Escalation Awesome Script \(.sh\)**

## BeRoot

BeRoot Project is a post exploitation tool to check common misconfigurations to find a way to escalate our privilege.  
 It has been added to the [pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy/) project as a post exploitation module \(so it will be executed in memory without touching the disk\).

Link: [https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot)

Windows pre compiled versions: [https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot/releases](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot/releases)

Linux: [https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot/tree/master/Linux](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot/tree/master/Linux)

## Unix privesc check

Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems \(tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2\). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps \(e.g. databases\). 

Link: [https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check) 

Usage: 

`$ ./unix-privesc-check > output.txt` 

## Windows-Exploit-Suggester

This tool compares a targets patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins. 

It requires the 'systeminfo' command output from a Windows host in order to compare that the Microsoft security bulletin database and determine the patch level of the host. 

**USAGE**:

update the database :

```text
$ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update 
[*] initiating... 
[*] successfully requested base url 
[*] scraped ms download url 
[+] writing to file 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx 
[*] done 
```

feed it "systeminfo" input, and point it to the microsoft database 

`$ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx --systeminfo win7sp1-systeminfo.txt` 

## Linux Exploit Suggester

When run without arguments, the script performs a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux operating system release version, and returns a list of possible exploits. Links to CVEs and applicable exploit POCs are included. Keep in mind that a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script. 

Usage: 

`$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.pl` 

## Solaris Exploit suggester

This tool reads the output of “showrev -p” on Solaris machines and outputs a list of exploits that you might want to try.  It currently focusses on local exploitation of Solaris 8 on SPARC, but other version of Solaris are partially supported. 

Link: 

[http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/exploit-suggester](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/exploit-suggester) 

**Example Output**:

```text
$ head showrev.out

## Nishang

Nishang is a framework and collection of scripts and payloads which enables usage of PowerShell for offensive security, penetration testing and red teaming. Nishang is useful during all phases of penetration testing.

**Link**: [https://github.com/samratashok/nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) 

Also installed by default on Kali: 

`root@kali:~# ls -l /usr/share/nishang/` 

Escalation scripts:
