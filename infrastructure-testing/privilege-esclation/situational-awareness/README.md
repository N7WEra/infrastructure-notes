# Situational Awareness

A common step in the life-cycle of a red team engagement is to gather as much information is possible for the compromised environments and the domain network. This activity is often called situational awareness and there is no defined list of commands that a red teamer should execute. However all the gathered information in that stage will determine the next actions towards privilege escalation and lateral movement and will assist to map the domain.
