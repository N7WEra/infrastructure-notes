## Info

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols \(e.g. SMB1-3 and MSRPC\) the protocol implementation itself. 

Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library. 

The following protocols are featured in Impacket 

* Ethernet, Linux "Cooked" capture. 
* IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP. 
* IPv4 and IPv6 Support. 
* NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 \(high-level implementations\). 
* MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP. 
* Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password/hashes/tickets/keys. 
* Portions/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, DCOM, WMI 
* Portions of TDS \(MSSQL\) and LDAP protocol implementations. 

## Examples for scripts

### mssqlclient

An MSSQL client, supporting SQL and Windows Authentications \(hashes too\). It also supports TLS.

connect with mssqlclient.py. I’ll make sure to use the -windows-auth flag

```text

```

### GetUsersSPNs

This example will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with JtR and HashCat. 

Get hashes: 

`GetUserSPNs.py -request -save -dc-ip <IP> domain/user` 

### SMBServer

A generic SMB client that will let you list shares and files, rename, upload and download files and create and delete directories, all using either username and password or username and hashes combination. It's an excellent example to see how to use impacket.smb in action. 

To get the server up and running on our local box, simple enter the following syntax: 

Starting the Server: 

/usr/bin/impacket-smbserver.py shareName sharePath {USE USERNAME and PASSWORD} 

* shareName - can be anything you want, but you’ll need to know this in order to connect back to the share 
* sharePath - the folder you want shared 

Using username and password smb smbv2: 

```text
smbserver.py -smb2support share . -username df -password df                                                                               
```

### secretsdump

Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For SAM and LSA Secrets \(including cached creds\) we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives in the target system \(%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory\) and read the rest of the data from there. For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials \(if available\) and Kerberos keys using the DL\_DRSGetNCChanges\(\) method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available \(e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled\). After the work is done, things are restored to the original state.

### GetNPUsers

 `AS-REP` roasting is an attack that is often-overlooked in my opinion it is not extremely common as you have to explicitly set `Accounts Does not Require Pre-Authentication` aka `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH`

## Full list of tools that featured in Impacket 

### Remote Execution 

* [psexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/psexec.py) PSEXEC like functionality example using RemComSvc\([https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom)\). 
* [smbexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/smbexec.py) A similar approach to PSEXEC w/o using RemComSvc. The technique is described [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625065218/http:/blog.accuvant.com/rdavisaccuvant/owning-computers-without-shell-access/). Our implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available. 
* [atexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/atexec.py) This example executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command. 
* [wmiexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/wmiexec.py) A semi-interactive shell, used through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not require to install any service/agent at the target server. Runs as Administrator. Highly stealthy. 
* [dcomexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/dcomexec.py) A semi-interactive shell similar to wmiexec.py, but using different DCOM endpoints. Currently supports MMC20.Application, ShellWindows and ShellBrowserWindow objects. 

### Kerberos 

* [GetTGT.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/getTGT.py) Given a password, hash or aesKey, this script will request a TGT and save it as ccache. 
* [GetST.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/getST.py) Given a password, hash, aesKey or TGT in ccache, this script will request a Service Ticket and save it as ccache. If the account has constrained delegation \(with protocol transition\) privileges you will be able to use the -impersonate switch to request the ticket on behalf another user. 
* [GetPac.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/getPac.py) This script will get the PAC \(Privilege Attribute Certificate\) structure of the specified target user just having a normal authenticated user credentials. It does so by using a mix of \[MS-SFU\]'s S4USelf + User to User Kerberos Authentication. 
* [GetUserSPNs.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) This example will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with JtR and HashCat. 
* [GetNPUsers.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/GetNPUsers.py) This example will attempt to list and get TGTs for those users that have the property 'Do not require Kerberos preauthentication' set \(UF\_DONT\_REQUIRE\_PREAUTH\). Output is compatible with JtR. 
* [ticketer.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/ticketer.py) This script will create Golden/Silver tickets from scratch or based on a template \(legally requested from the KDC\) allowing you to customize some of the parameters set inside the PAC\_LOGON\_INFO structure, in particular the groups, ExtraSids, duration, etc. 
* [raiseChild.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/raiseChild.py) This script implements a child-domain to forest privilege escalation by \(ab\)using the concept of Golden Tickets and ExtraSids. 

### Windows Secrets 

* [secretsdump.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/secretsdump.py) Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For SAM and LSA Secrets \(including cached creds\) we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives in the target system \(%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory\) and read the rest of the data from there. For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials \(if available\) and Kerberos keys using the DL\_DRSGetNCChanges\(\) method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available \(e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled\).

The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed \(e.g. create a user through LDAP\) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. In this mode, for every connection relayed, it will be available to be used later on multiple times through a SOCKS proxy. 
* [karmaSMB.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/karmaSMB.py) A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified.

* [smbrelayx.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/smbrelayx.py) Exploit for CVE-2015-0005 using a SMB Relay Attack. If the target system is enforcing signing and a machine account was provided, the module will try to gather the SMB session key through NETLOGON. 

### SMB/MSRPC 

* [smbclient.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/examples/smbclient.py) A generic SMB client that will let you list shares and files, rename, upload and download files and create and delete directories, all using either username and password or username and hashes combination.
