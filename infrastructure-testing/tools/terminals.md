# Terminals

## tmux

**What is tmux?** 

tmux  is like screen + terminator combined, The biggest benefit for tmux is  that it run the terminal as a process and not bind to the session,  sessions won’t die if you were disconnected. 

**How to install?** 

tmux is build in into Kali, but if not you can install it as ‘apt install tmux’ 

**Starting tmux** 

For every engagements it’s recommended to create new session which will be for that engagement, by typing: 

`tmux new –s %NAME%` 

\(replace name with the name of engagement\).Notice  on the bottom terminal there is a green line with all the information  on each window. \(where there is a star next to the name it mean you  currently viewing this window\)Each windows have a number and a name, the name can be changed.For each command we will need to press the prefix key \(which is by default ctrl +b\) first. 

**Simple commands:** 

To start a new windows in the terminal press prefix \(ctrl +b\) + c. 

To move between windows press the prefix and the number of the window you want to move to. 

Change windows name: Prefix + , 

Rename the session: Prefix + $ 

**Attach, Detach and Kill:** 

To  exit the tmux session press prefix + d – and it will detach the current  session and return to your normal shell \(this won’t kill your session\) 

To  re-attach the session write ‘tmux attach-session’ or ‘tmux a’ \( we can  even create multiple sessions and attach based on numbers\)You can view all the current sessions by running ‘tmux ls’ 

**Tmux configuration file** 

You can customise the tmux configuration by creating a 

~/.tmux.conf 

tmux will pick this configuration file for your current user 

In the configuration file you can change the prefix key, extend the scroll back \(history\) 

set -g history-limit 10000 \(extend the history\) 

set -g allow-rename off \(stop from the session to rename the windows automatically\) 

**Splitting screens** 

Prefix + % - split the screen vertically 

Prefix + “  -split the screen horizontally 

Prefix + &lt;arrow key&gt; to move between the screens 

Prefix + Z – to zoom into one screen \(and also to exit the screen from zoom\) 

Prefix + { - replace the screen location to the left 

Prefix + } – replace the screen location to the right 

Prefix + &lt;Space&gt; -  change layout 

**Few other tricks:** 

Press ctrl +a to go to the beginning of the line 

Press ctrl +e to get to the end of the line 

Press ctrl and a arrow key to go word by word 

Prefix+ t  - show the time
